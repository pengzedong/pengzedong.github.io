    <!-- Research Overview -->
    <div class="prose-custom max-w-4xl mb-12">
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My research focuses on advancing software engineering practices through innovative approaches to requirements engineering, automated testing, and software quality assurance. I develop AI-driven techniques to bridge the gap between software requirements and implementation, with particular emphasis on traceability, metamorphic testing, and vulnerability detection.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A central theme in my work is leveraging natural language processing and machine learning to automate and improve traditionally manual software engineering tasks. This includes developing novel methods for requirements abstraction identification, test case generation from natural language specifications, and automated detection of software vulnerabilities in open-source systems.
